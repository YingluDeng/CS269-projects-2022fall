> These years, the tech giant companies have set off a boom in the development of autonomous driving, Waymo began as the Google self-driving car project in 2009, and the Tesla Motors announced its first version of Autopilot in 2014. So our team would also like to explore the autonomous driving skills by reinforcement learning.

For this project, we will train a reinforcement learning model and deliver an autonomous car simulate the real urban environment by using [CARLA](https://carla.org/). The goal is to develop a car that can distinguish the complex urban layouts, avoid the barriers on the street and have different actions towards corresponding situations such as making a turn, slowing down and braking. 

Through viewing the CARLA paper [Autonomous Vehicle Control in CARLA Challenge](https://ebuah.uah.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/10017/45428/Autonomous_Egido_FIT_2020.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1), we got interested working in the CARLA simulation for our autonomous driving cars. It is a perfect simulation for training the reinforcement learning to reach our goal. Tons of teams test their projects' performance through the platform of CARLA. For example, a team implements the DDPG car - [DDPG car-following model with real-world human driving experience in CARLA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14602v1.pdf). CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving system. 

## Environments
### CARLA
CARLA is a driving simulator with the following key features:
- Traffic Manager: CARLA creates the Traffic Manager to simulate a traffic environment similar to the real world. Users can define different models, behavior models, and speeds of vehicles to interact with the Ego-Vehicle. 
- Sensors: CARLA contains all kinds of sensor model simulating the real world, including cameras, Lidar, IMU, GNSS, and so on. The photos even have distortion and motion blur effects in order to mimic the effects in the real world. User can attach these sensors to different cars to collect various data. 
- Recorder: The recorder module is used to record the status of each step for the purpose of reviewing, reproducing. 
- ROS bridge: CARLA can interact with ROS and Autoware. This module is important for testing the autopilot system in simulation. 
- Open Assest: Developer can add a customized object library to the simulation world with this module. For example, we can add a cool flying car to the default vehicle blueprint and the Client module can use it.
